title: "Multiple Semantic Matching on Augmented N-Partite Graph for Object Co-Segmentation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/TIP2017
excerpt: 'Recent methods for object co-segmentation focus on discovering single co-occurring relation of candidate regions representing the foreground of multiple images. However, region extraction based only on low and middle level information often occupies a large area of background without the help of semantic context. In addition, seeking single matching solution very likely leads to discover local parts of common objects. To cope with these deficiencies, we present a new object co-segmentation framework, which takes advantages of semantic information and globally explores multiple co-occurring matching cliques based on an N-partite graph structure.'
