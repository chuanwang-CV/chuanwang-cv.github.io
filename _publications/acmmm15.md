excerpt: " Our method has following characteristics. Firstly, it is a deep model built on CNN to automatically learn eâ†µective features for counting. Besides, to weaken influence of background like buildings and trees, we purposely enrich the training data with expanded negative samples whose ground truth counting is
set as zero. With these negative samples, the robustness can be enhanced. <br/> <img src='/images/crowdcounting.png' width='200' height = '200' align=center>"

People counting in extremely dense crowds is an important step for video surveillance and anomaly warning. The problem becomes especially more challenging due to the lack
of training samples, severe occlusions, cluttered scenes and variation of perspective. Existing methods either resort to auxiliary human and face detectors or surrogate by estimating the density of crowds. Most of them rely on hand-crafted
features, such as SIFT, HOG etc, and thus are prone to fail when density grows or the training sample is scarce.
